ember g route stocks

>A nested route is a sub child of the basic route 
(example: pse-stocks.com/stocks/blue-chips) 
ember g route stocks/blue-chips

>An index route is basically the basic route but its 
content wont be passed onti the child which is the nested route
(example: pse-stocks.com/stocks) 
ember g route stocks/index

>A dynamic route is a page to display the same route to different items 
(example: pse-stocks.com/item/123) 
ember g route item 
(this is also a basic route but remember to change its config in router.js and to set an model 
to routes/item.js or routeName.js t)
// { path: '/item/:item_id'}

>A 404 not found or Wildcard route is to redirect unmanaged or non existing routes
(example: pse-stocks.com/not-found) 
ember g route not-found 
(this is also a basic route but remember to change its config in router.js)
// { path: '/*path'}
